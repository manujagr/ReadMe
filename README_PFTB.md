# Quantitative Portfolio Management

In this course, you have learned how to install the python packages, importing the packages and importing the data. You have also learned functions, data structures and data visualisation in Python. You have also been made aware of the Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy. All these codes are provided in this downloadables folder.

## This readme file has the following sections:
1. Prerequisites
2. Installing packages
3. Running the code
4. Folder structure
5. Authors

## Prerequisites:
Before running these notebooks, you need to setup a Python environment on your local machine. If already present, make sure the Python version is 3.6.8. To change the Python version, open the Anaconda prompt and type the following command: 

	conda install python=3.6.8

## Installing packages:
We have used the following Python libraries in the course. Kindly ensure you have these libraries installed with the same versions as mentioned below. To install the same version on your local system, type these commands on IPython notebook.

    !pip install numpy==1.16.4
    !pip install pandas==0.23.4
    !pip install matplotlib==2.2.3
    !pip install alpha_vantage==2.1.0
    !pip install bokeh==0.13.0
    !pip install fix-yahoo-finance==0.0.22
    !pip install nsepy==0.7
    !pip install pandas-datareader==0.7.0
    !pip install Quandl==3.4.5
    !pip install seaborn==0.9.0
    !pip install iexfinance==0.3.5
    !pip install scipy==1.1.0
    !pip install mpl-finance==0.10.0
  
## Running the code:
Once you have your system in place, you can run the notebooks using Jupyter interface. This is installed along with Anaconda.

## Folder structure:
This folder contains 8 subfolders divided based on the sections of the course. Each subfolder contains the IPython notebooks and the data required to run them in that particular section.

	1. Hello Python:
		a. My First Python Code.ipynb
		b. How to install packages in Python.ipynb
		c. How to install packages in Python.ipynb

		   You will need this file while running the code.
		   You need to write your own Quandl API key at line 12 in quantrautil.py file. 
		   To get the Quandl API key, sign up for a free Quandl account.
		   Then you can find your API key on Quandl account settings page.
