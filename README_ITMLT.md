# Quantitative Portfolio Management

In this course, you have learned how to code the three capital allocation methods namely, MPT, Kelly Criterion and Risk Parity in Python. You have also calculated Beta, expected returns using the Fama French three-factor model and created a strategy using momentum and short-term reversal factors in Python. All these codes are provided in this downloadables folder.

## This readme file has the following sections:
1. Prerequisites
2. Installing packages
3. Running the code
4. Folder structure
5. Authors
6. Acknowledgements

## Prerequisites:
Before running these notebooks, you need to setup a Python environment on your local machine. If already present, make sure the Python version is 3.6.8. To change the Python version, open the Anaconda prompt and type the following command: 

	conda install python=3.6.8

## Installing packages:
We have used the following Python libraries in the course. Kindly ensure you have these libraries installed with the same versions as mentioned below. To install the same version on your local system. Type this command on IPython notebook.

    !pip install numpy==1.16.4
    !pip install pandas==0.23.4
    !pip install matplotlib==2.2.3
    !pip install cvxpy==1.0.24
  
## Running the code:
Once you have your system in place, you can run the notebooks using Jupyter interface. This is installed along with Anaconda.

## Folder structure:
This folder contains 8 subfolders divided based on the sections of the course. Each subfolder contains the IPython notebooks and the data required to run them in that particular section.
